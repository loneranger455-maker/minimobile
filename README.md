## Installation and running
Installing and running is easy if you are running on windows.Linux users need to use wine as this program uses a windows api.
For windows:
● Git clone to a directory you want
● double click on minimobile.exe and you are running the program.

For Linux(doesn't work that well though):
● Git clone to a directory
● Install wine if not installed.Please follow a guideline for your specific distribution for its installation.
● wine {directory where your minimobile.exe resides}
note:minimobile.exe lies in your minimobile folder you have cloned
